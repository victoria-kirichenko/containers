# containers
Implementation of the containers.h library:
- list
- queue (inherited from the list)
- stack
- vector
- array
- map (balance tree)
- set
- multiset (inherited from the set)

There are tests that can be run using the Makefile

This is a group project, my task was to implement the map library and fully cover it with tests using the gtest.h library
